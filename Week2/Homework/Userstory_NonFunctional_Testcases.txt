| **NFT_001** | Performance                 | Validate API response time under normal load conditions.       | Ensure API returns a response within acceptable SLA (e.g., ≤ 500 ms) for standard transaction requests.                                            | API consistently responds within defined SLA limits.                                                                                            |
| **NFT_002** | Load & Scalability          | Execute high-volume concurrent API requests.                   | Verify system can handle expected peak traffic (e.g., 1000+ concurrent requests) without degradation.                                               | API maintains stability, throughput, and response time under peak load.                                                                         |
| **NFT_003** | Security                    | Validate secure access using OAuth 2.0 tokens or API keys.     | Ensure only authorized clients can access API endpoints.                                                                                           | Unauthorized access is blocked with appropriate **401/403** responses.                                                                           |
| **NFT_004** | Data Privacy & Compliance   | Validate that sensitive banking data (account numbers, PII) is encrypted and masked in responses/logs. | Ensure compliance with **PCI DSS** and data protection standards.                                                                                  | All sensitive data is **encrypted in transit** (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+) and **masked in logs**.                                                          |
| **NFT_005** | Reliability & Failover      | Simulate API node/server failure during active transactions.   | Verify system maintains availability and consistency through redundancy or failover mechanisms.                                                    | Requests are auto-routed to backup instance with **no data loss or downtime**.                                                                   |
| **NFT_006** | Usability & Documentation   | Review API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).                    | Ensure developers can easily integrate using provided documentation and error codes.                                                               | Documentation **accurately reflects** API endpoints, parameters, request/response examples, and error codes.                                    |
| **NFT_007** | Error Handling & Consistency| Trigger multiple error scenarios (invalid input, timeout, unauthorized). | Validate API returns meaningful, standardized error messages and HTTP status codes.                                                                | All errors follow a **consistent JSON schema** and return **proper HTTP status codes** (e.g., 400, 401, 500).                                   |
| **NFT_008** | Audit & Observability       | Verify transaction traceability and logging.                   | Ensure every API request and response is logged for audit and compliance tracking.                                                                 | API logs contain **unique transaction IDs**, **timestamps**, and **user context**—**without exposing sensitive data**.                          |
