Formatted output:


| Test Case ID | Test Case Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NF-001** | **Performance Test**<br>Test the API's response time under a normal load of 100 concurrent users. | The API should respond within 2 seconds for 90% of the requests. |
| **NF-002** | **Security Test**<br>Test the API's vulnerability to SQL injection attacks by sending malicious input. | The API should prevent SQL injection attacks and return an appropriate error message without data compromise. |
| **NF-003** | **Scalability Test**<br>Test the API's ability to handle a large number of concurrent users (1000+) without a significant decrease in performance. | The API should handle the increased load without a performance degradation of more than 20%. |
| **NF-004** | **Availability Test**<br>Test the API's uptime and availability over a 24-hour period. | The API should be available for at least 99.9% of the time. |
| **NF-005** | **Usability Test**<br>Test the API's documentation and ease of use for third-party developers. | The documentation should be clear and concise, enabling developers to successfully integrate with the API within 2 hours. |
| **NF-006** | **Reliability Test**<br>Test the API's ability to recover from failures and exceptions. | The API should automatically recover from failures and exceptions within 5 minutes. |
| **NF-007** | **Compliance Test**<br>Test the API's compliance with relevant banking regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR). | The API must comply with all relevant banking regulations, with no critical violations found. |
| **NF-008** | **Load Test**<br>Test the API's ability to handle a large volume of requests (1000+ requests per second) without a significant decrease in performance. | The API should handle the increased load without a performance degradation of more than 30%. |
